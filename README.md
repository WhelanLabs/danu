# Danu AI

## About
Danu AI is a Windows-based search engine with embedded AI capabilities. It is designed to serve organizations with private, 
non-Internet-accessible data, providing both search results and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) of AI responses.

### Why Danu AI?  
Organizations often handle sensitive or proprietary data that cannot be shared externally or indexed by public search engines. 
Danu AI enables these organizations to:  
- **Securely access private data:** Ensure critical information stays within the organization.  
- **Enhance productivity:** Provide quick, accurate search results tailored to the organization's unique datasets.  
- **Leverage AI for insights:** Use RAG to generate insightful and contextually relevant responses, boosting decision-making and efficiency.  
- **Maintain compliance:** Adhere to privacy regulations by keeping data localized and under strict control.

âš  **Note:** Danu AI is in its alpha stage and not yet ready for end-user deployment. It is publicly available to facilitate collaboration among contributors.

## Build, Install, and Run

### Build Environment Prerequisites
Ensure the following tools are installed and added to your system's PATH before building Danu AI:
- **Gradle**
- **Java 1.8+**
- **NSIS**: [Download NSIS 3.10](https://sourceforge.net/projects/nsis/files/NSIS%203/3.10/nsis-3.10-setup.exe/download)

### Build Steps
1. Navigate to the projectâ€™s root directory.
2. Run the following command:
   ```DOS
   build.bat
   ```

> **Note**  
> Danu also supports an advanced mode of being built using a Hyper-V VM which requires Hyper-V be installed
> on the host machine. To build using Hyper-V, open a powershell window, and run "vm_based_build.bat" instead of "build.bat".
> The Hyper-V based build requires that `Win11_24H2_English_x64.iso' be located in the download directory. The ISO image can
> be manually downloaded from https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows11.

#### Build Notes
- The download step may occasionally fail to fetch Apache dependencies, possibly due to Apache CDN issues. 
As a workaround, manually download the required dependencies and place them in the designated directory. 
Refer to `build.gradle` for a list of sources.

- The build output will be located at:
  ```DOS
  out\DanuAI_Installer.exe
  ```
  This is an NSIS-based installer.
